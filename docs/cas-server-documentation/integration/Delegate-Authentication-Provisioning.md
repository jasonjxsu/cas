# Delegated Authentication Provisioning

By default, user profiles that are extracted from external identity providers and merged into a CAS
authenticated principal are not stored or tracked anywhere. CAS does provide additional options to allow
such profiles to be managed outside of CAS and/or provisioned into identity stores, allowing you optionally to link
external/guest accounts with their equivalent found in the authentication source used by CAS, etc.

## Groovy Provisioner
   
{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pac4j.provisioning.groovy" %}

Provisioning tasks can be carried out using an external Groovy script with the following structure:

```groovy
def run(Object[] args) {
    def principal = args[0]
    def userProfile = args[1]
    def client = args[2]
    def logger = args[3]
    ...
}
```

It is not expected for the script to return a value. The following parameters are passed to the script:

| Parameter             | Description
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `principal`           | CAS authenticated `Principal` that contains all attributes and claims.
| `userProfile`         | The original `UserProfile` extracted from the external identity provider. 
| `client`              | The `Client` configuration responsible for the exchange between CAS and the identity provider. 
| `logger`              | The object responsible for issuing log messages such as `logger.info(...)`.

## REST Provisioner

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pac4j.provisioning.rest" %}

Provisioning tasks can be carried out using an external REST endpoint expected to receive the following:
     
| Header                  | Description
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `principalId`           | CAS authenticated principal identifier.
| `principalAttributes`   | CAS authenticated principal attributes.
| `profileId`             | The identifier of the user profile extracted from the identity provider. 
| `profileTypedId`        | The *typed* identifier of the user profile extracted from the identity provider. 
| `profileAttributes`     | Collection of attributes extracted from the identity provider's response.
| `clientName`            | The client name responsible for the exchange between CAS and the identity provider.
    
## Custom Provisioner

If you wish to create your own provisioner for delegated authentication, you will need to
design a component and register it with CAS as such:

```java
@Bean
public DelegatedClientUserProfileProvisioner clientUserProfileProvisioner() {
    return new CustomDelegatedClientUserProfileProvisioner();
}
```

[See this guide](../configuration/Configuration-Management-Extensions.html) to learn more about
how to register configurations into the CAS runtime.
