# RC1 Release Notes

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set
you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA`
is [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based
releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular
release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

## Apereo Membership

If you benefit from Apereo CAS as free and open-source software, we invite you
to [join the Apereo Foundation](https://www.apereo.org/content/apereo-membership)
and financially support the project at a capacity that best suits your deployment. Note that all development activity is performed
*almost exclusively* on a voluntary basis with no expectations, commitments or strings attached. Having the financial means to better
sustain engineering activities will allow the developer community to allocate *dedicated and committed* time for long-term support,
maintenance and release planning, especially when it comes to addressing critical and security issues in a timely manner. Funding will
ensure support for the software you rely on and you gain an advantage and say in the way Apereo, and the CAS project at that, runs and
operates. If you consider your CAS deployment to be a critical part of the identity and access management ecosystem, this is a viable option
to consider.

## Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
- Better yet, [contribute patches](/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
- Suggest and apply documentation improvements.

## Resources

- [Release Schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones)
- [Release Policy](/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html)

## Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of the [CAS WAR Overlay](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Installation.html), adjust the following setting:

```properties
cas.version=6.5.0-RC1
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>System Requirements</strong><br/>There are no changes to the 
minimum system/platform requirements for this release.
</div>

## New & Noteworthy

The following items are new improvements and enhancements presented in this release.

### CAS Initializr

The overlay projects backed and generated by the [CAS Initializr](../installation/WAR-Overlay-Initializr.html)
are now put into a ready-made git repository. Such projects are also prepared by default for cloud deployments on the Heroku platform.
Furthermore, the metadata for the CAS Initializr is now updated to support version compatibility ranges. This would come handy to indicate
the relationship between a given CAS module and a CAS version that is able to present and work with that module.

### CAS Documentation

CAS documentation is now pre-built and pushed to Github Pages using Jekyll v4, rather than letting GitHub Pages build the documentation from
source. This approach is recommended by GitHub and Jekyll so as to assist with Github Pages build performance and configuration.

### Delegated Authentication Discovery Selection

Additional options are now available to [Delegated Authentication](../integration/Delegate-Authentication.html)
to assist with the discovery and selection of identity providers in more dynamic ways.

### SmsMode Integration

[SMSMode](../notifications/SMS-Messaging-Configuration-SmsMode.html) can now be used as an SMS provider to handle text-message
notifications.

### Google Authenticator via DynamoDb

Google Authenticator registration records and tokens may now be kept inside
a [DynamoDb instance](../mfa/GoogleAuthenticator-Authentication-Registration-DynamoDb.html).

### Azure CosmosDb Service Registry

Azure SDK for CosmosDb is now upgraded to v4, and integration tests for CosmosDb are now updated to take advantage of the latest CosmosDb
emulator versions to exercise the test suite for the [CosmosDb service registry](../services/CosmosDb-Service-Management.html)
implementation.

### Hazelcast Discovery via Apache Zookeeper

Apache Zookeeper can now be used to handle [auto discovery of Hazelcast members](../ticketing/Hazelcast-Ticket-Registry.html) in a cluster.

### JDK 17 Compatibility

CAS is able to build and run successfully against the latest versions of JDK 17. The JDK baseline requirement continues to be set at JDK 11,
and this release is keeping up with JDK releases to ensure CAS can correctly switch the baseline requirement when deemed necessary.

### Localization Per Service

Language bundle and localization rules can now be applied
conditionally [on a per-application basis](../ux/User-Interface-Customization-Localization.html).

### InfluxDb v2 Integration

[Integrations with InfluxDb](../authentication/Configuring-Authentication-Events-InfluxDb.html) to support authentication event tracking and
storage is now updated to support InfluxDb v2.

### Webflow Interrupts Per Service

Application definitions [can now be assigned](../webflow/Webflow-Customization-Interrupt.html) a dedicated webflow interrupt policy to
manage and handle interrupt notifications on a per-service basis. This is the preferred and recommended strategy going forward, and other
options/properties that skip/disable interrupts for applications are now deprecated and scheduled to be removed. As a consequence, interrupt
policies are now able to determine whether executions should be always forced, globally or at the service level.

## Other Stuff

- SAML2 Unsolicited endpoint is now able to preserve custom query parameters.
- [SSO sessions endpoint](../authentication/Configuring-SSO.html) is now able to narrow down SSO sessions for a specific user.
- Signing SAML2 assertions can now honor the `WantAssertionsSigned` flag in the service provider metadata.
- LDAP search entry handlers are now able to merges the values of one or more attributes in all entries into a single attribute.
- SAML2 authentication requests that do not specify a protocol binding are pre-processed to locate the proper binding correctly.
- Attribute resolution via Person Directory can optionally be taught to *not* recover from exceptions and block.
- Default redirect URLs can now also be used for logout attempts, when no authorized destination is defined.
- [Attribute Consent](../integration/Attribute-Release-Consent.html) is now given a dedicated setting to exclude attributes globally.
- Deleting ticket-granting tickets [via REST](../protocol/REST-Protocol-Request-TicketGrantingTicket.html) should now initiate SLO.
