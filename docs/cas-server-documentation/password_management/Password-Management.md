# Password Management

If authentication fails due to a rejected password policy, CAS is able to intercept
that request and allow the user to update the account password in place. The password management 
features of CAS are rather modest, and alternatively should the functionality provide inadequate 
for your policy, you may always redirect CAS to use a separate and standalone application 
that is fully in charge of managing the account password and associated flows.

CAS may also allow users to reset their passwords voluntarily. Those who have forgotten their account password
may receive a secure link with a time-based expiration policy at their registered email address and/or phone. The link
will allow the user to provide answers to his/her pre-defined security questions, which if successfully done,
will allow the user to next reset their password and login again. You may also specify a pattern for accepted passwords. 

By default, after a user has successfully changed their password they will be redirected to the login screen
to enter their new password and log in. CAS can also be configured to automatically log the user in after
a successful change. This behavior can be altered via CAS settings. 

Support is enabled by including the following dependency in the WAR overlay:

{% include_cached casmodule.html group="org.apereo.cas" module="cas-server-support-pm-webflow" %}

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>YAGNI</strong><p>You do not need to explicitly include this module
in your configuration and overlays. This is just to teach you that it exists.</p></div>

## Configuration

To learn more about available notification options, please [see this guide](../notifications/SMS-Messaging-Configuration.html) 
or [this guide](../notifications/Sending-Email-Configuration.html). 

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pm.core,cas.authn.pm.webflow" %}

### Password Reset

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pm.reset" %}

### reCAPTCHA Integration

Password reset attempts can be protected and integrated 
with [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha). This requires 
the presence of reCAPTCHA settings for the basic integration and instructing 
the password management flow to turn on and verify requests via reCAPTCHA. 

{% include_cached casproperties.html properties="cas.authn.pm.google-recaptcha" %}
